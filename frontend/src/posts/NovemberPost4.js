# Oh oh AuuuuGUST

#### November 27th, 2020 by Andy French

And here we are!!! Youâ€™ve made it thru two weeks of Andy updates and weâ€™ve stumbled upon Volume 4 - August 2020!! ðŸ˜¯

Now my goodness! This was a busy one.

At this time the priorities were, go out! This was a very social time, featuring lots of BYOs and lots of crack up nights out. Something that we were well over due for! And to be fair, my priorities now are still pretty similar, get out and go to all gigs! But this month was particularly special. 

It saw the first ever Arena Rave, which saw Grass Stâ€™s first ever kickonz (so wholesome!) and a couple of nights ending in snaps on the infamous Bluewater Bar and Grill in Oriental Bay. 
 
And if you scroll right to the end, you can see myself and the lovely Queen McSweeney(@annamcsweeney) jumping off the Te Papa platform at 3am! 
Maybe the most exhilarating feeling of my life! ðŸ’¥
