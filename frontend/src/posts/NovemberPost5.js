Volume 5 - September 2020! Now we’re getting close to catching up to the present!! 😯

And at this time, New Zealand had just been rocked by some mystery community cases and things were starting to look a pear-shaped. Lockdown was looming, potential scary times ahead.
However, I had flights to Dunedin to go see the legendary @dave_french at this exact time!
I tossed and I turned, called up Mother French to see what I should do and she said to me - “Andrew, who knows when the next time you’ll see family is? You HAVE to go.” - And so just like that I got the green light from mum to have a bender in Dunnerz. But some wise words from mum.

And so September started off with a HUGE bang! 
It also saw a bottomless brunch upon the arrival of the one and only, @matthew_knight, and a legendary rave at the Grass St Gras at 8 Grass Street. 
Dunnerz, Bottomless Brunches with Buzz and the Grass Street Gras. What a month! 💥
