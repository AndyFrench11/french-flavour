# You can rock my tober...

Now goodness me we are heating up!! Time for Volume 6 - October!! üòÆ

And with summer arriving, it brings upon a time of people coming together! Xmas is just around the corner, New Years is on the horizon, it is a festive time to celebrate with friends and family! And how timely! Because I take you back to October - and particularly one weekend!

Now this one is a sight for sore eyes. At this time, I had the pleasure of having my old flatmates, some of Christchurch‚Äôs finest, come and stay and dip their toes into what the Wellington scene is like, seeing a bit of nightlife, seeing the close quarters of the flatting lifestyle and of course - a Shed 6 rave! 

And this was particularly special for me because I feel that when you move to a new city, you put yourself in a fully different environment. The people you surround yourself with, even just your day-to-day. And so it can be easy to lose touch with what your old lifestyle may have been!

And to have the friends who have been with you through thick and thin come into that environment and integrate seamlessly really brings warmth to my heart. It gives me confidence that I‚Äôm surrounding myself with some awesome people and can continue to grow in a real positive way!

So a particularly special month and weekend for me, and a bloody damn good rave too! 
So here‚Äôs a couple of snaps of some legendary humans for Volume 6 - topped off with a shock from @kieranmorrison - telling you to get out make the most of it this summer! ‚òÄÔ∏è
