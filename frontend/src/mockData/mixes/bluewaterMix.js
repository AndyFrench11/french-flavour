# The Bluewater Bar and Grill. 

#### Jan 25th, 2021 with Sounds of the Local

What a mix to start on!!

This is what kicked everything off, the idea of taking the decks up onto the Bluewater Bar and Grill and just seeing what happened!
And that's what we did! 

We had a MASSIVE crew and got everything up there, and then I threw down a cheeky Liquid Drum & Bass mix for an hour, and then we even chucked in some wobblers for the fans a bit later 😏

But anyways! I hope you enjoy, a HUGE thanks to Corb and the boys at Sounds of the Local for making this happen, it was such a special mix and a beautiful day to do it on!

Here's to the NZ music scene, and a showcase of Wellington!! 💥
