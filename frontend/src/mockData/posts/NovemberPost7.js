# Tea Party, we like to Party!

#### December 9th, 2020 by Andy French

And weâ€™re back at it!! This time I thought iâ€™d do a bit of special edition - Volume 7 - Tea Party!!! ðŸ˜¯
I had just so SO many photos from this day, with all of the boys dressed up as some delicious old women, that I just feel like I have to do a special post for this time!

So take yourselves back to mid-late October, the opportunity to go to Tea Party came up and I thought - surely one last hurrah down at the old stomping grounds! Why not?
And my golly gosh was it a good time! Another fantastic opportunity to see some of Christchurchâ€™s finest and some old faces which I had sorely missed!
So anyways, here are some fantastic snaps which I still donâ€™t think are showing enough thigh and some wide smiles from NZâ€™s cutest!

P.s. if you swipe right to the end, u can get a snippet into some of the sexy moves us ladies were throwin down! ðŸ˜‚
P.s. x2 I hope youâ€™re all enjoying these wee updates! It has been so heart-warming going through all these memories, itâ€™s getting me SO excited for whatâ€™s next! ðŸ’¥
