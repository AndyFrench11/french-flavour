# Get a bitta July in ya

#### November 23rd, 2020 by Andy French

And just like that - itâ€™s volume 3!!! ðŸ˜¯
Itâ€™s crazy to look back on this year and see that even amidst a pandemic, there have been many awesome memories made. 
For sure, there have been some lows, and some solid time spent just trying to figure out how to re-adjust to a world outside of lockdown. But in the end, that time spent has been so crucial in finding my place within the craziness! 

AND SO, here we are! Volume 3: July 2020! ðŸ˜¯
Ya boi is now a few months into the new job, one month down back in Welly and starting to get into the routine of life in a new job and city. 

And to sum up what happened in this wild time, there was: 
Some fantastic new flatmates, some fantastic experiences seeing old friends and family and some fantastic cuddles with bitey pals!
