# How good was June!

#### November 20th, 2020 by Andy French

And weâ€™re back again!!! We continue the trip down memory lane of this wild and peculiar year. 
So strap in for the next segment of these Andy updates!
Iâ€™ll call this Volume 2 - June 2020 ðŸ¤¨

Setting the scene: 
Weâ€™d all just settled back into normal life out of covid. ðŸ¦ 
Gigs were back on, and town had opened back up again. ðŸ’ƒ

And to sum up what happened in this wild time, there was: 
A cheeky wee trip down to Christchurch, seeing a beautiful night with beautiful people hosted by @soundsofthelocal. 
A couple of cheeky new faces sliding into the frame, and not enough cheeky shots of the man, the myth, the legend @kieranmorrison!
