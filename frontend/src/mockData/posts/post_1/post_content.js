# Welcome! 

#### Feb 22nd, 2021 by Andy French

What a crazy four weeks it has been. Gigs, mixes in crazy places, and meeting some amazing people. 
I really cannot put into words how unreal it has been!

And to bring it all together, we're launching the french flavour website!!
This website looks to be a one-stop shop for all things french flavour including music, mixes, photography, and cheeky wee stories by myself!

By day, I am a Software Engineer, so this gives me an opportunity to share my passion whilst doing something I love.
I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback about the website, as I'll be looking to continually improve it as time goes by.

So thank you for stopping by! I hope that there is something here for everyone, and that people can come together sharing through similar passions.
