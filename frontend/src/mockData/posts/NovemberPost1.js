# Time to reflect!

#### November 15th, 2020 by Andy French

Well MY GOODNESS!!! It has been a HOT MINUTE since ya boi Andy has posted something on social media! ðŸ’¥
Rewind about 6 months ago was the last time any of you lovely people got an update from me, and how rude! But I mean better late than never.

So I thought it would be nice over the next few weeks to do some posts over what my time in Welly has been like and take some time to reflect - because itâ€™s been a busy one! 
Iâ€™ll be taking you all on a trip down memory lane, starting from just after lockdown in April, moving back down to Welly. 

So Iâ€™ll call this Volume 1 - May 2020 ðŸ˜¯
And to sum up what happened in this wild time it was: new decks in the room, a new house in Oriental Bay, new mates at BYOs and new experiences with long lost cousins!
